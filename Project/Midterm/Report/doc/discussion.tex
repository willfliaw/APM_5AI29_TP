% Comparison with expectations, limitations, lessons learned, and perspectives.


To mitigate errors encountered, future work will explore refining hyperparameters and incorporating negative sampling strategies to improve generalization. Moreover, Hetionet contains biomedical data with heterogeneous relationships, which may require more complex models to capture the underlying patterns. We also recommend exploring integration with other families of models such as rule-based models (non-embedding methods like AnyBURL) if embeddings fail to capture biomedical patterns, pretrained and meta-learning models (BoxE) for modeling constraints in large datasets, CNN-based models (ConvE, R-GCN) for better capture local features effectively, or advanced models (HolE, AutoSF) for complex and heterogeneous dataset like Hetionet.
