This report explores the performance of knowledge graph embedding models for link prediction, focusing on a comparative analysis between PyKEEN's embedding models and large language model (LLM)-based approaches.
Using the Hetionet biomedical knowledge graph as a testbed, we evaluate the predictive capabilities of various PyKEEN models and introduce a novel method that leverages Llama embeddings, with and without retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to enhance link prediction.
