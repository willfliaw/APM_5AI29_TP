# Knowledge Graph Completion Project

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing knowledge graph completion using [PyKEEN](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) with a selected dataset. The objective is to explore multi-class link prediction by integrating PyKEEN models with a large language model (LLM).

Note: This is not intended to be a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques in the field.

## Objectives

-   Implement PyKEEN to perform knowledge graph embedding and completion.
-   Dataset: It is recommended to use the dataset provided by Professor Mehwish.
-   LLM Integration: Explore how PyKEEN can be integrated with a large language model to enhance predictions or interpret results.
