\section*{Abstract}

This midterm report presents a project combining PyKEEN and large language models (LLMs) to address knowledge graph completion, focusing on multi-class link prediction. By leveraging PyKEEN's graph embedding capabilities and LLMs' contextual understanding, the approach aims to predict missing links and classify their types, with applications such as drug repurposing through the inference of treats relationships in biomedical knowledge graphs.
