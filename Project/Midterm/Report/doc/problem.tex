\section*{Problem Statement}

% Explain which problem (and task) you're addressing. It should be framed as a problem (typically something desirable we want, or something undesirable we don't want, or something we don't understand, or something surprising).

Knowledge graphs are valuable tools for representing complex relationships between entities. However, a significant challenge arises from their inherent incompleteness, as many potential connections between entities are missing. This lack of information limits the utility and accuracy of downstream applications such as recommendation systems, biomedical research, and drug repurposing, which is an initial departing point for the present academic work.

The objective of this project is to address this issue by employing knowledge graph embedding techniques through PyKEEN \cite{pykeen} to predict and classify missing links, thereby enriching the graph. Additionally, the project explores how large language models (LLMs) could further enhance or complement traditional embedding-based approaches. We intend to investigate several LLM-based methods, including zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to assess their effectiveness in knowledge graph completion tasks.
